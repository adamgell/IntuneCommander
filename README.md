# Intune Commander - .NET Remake

A cross-platform Intune management tool built with .NET 10 and Avalonia UI, designed to overcome PowerShell WPF limitations in threading, UI refresh, and data caching.

## Project Overview

### Goals
- **Multi-cloud support:** Commercial, GCC, GCC-High, DoD tenants
- **Multi-tenant:** Easy switching between tenant environments with profile management
- **Native performance:** Compiled .NET code eliminates PowerShell threading issues
- **Cross-platform:** Linux and macOS support via Avalonia (EVENTUALLY)
- **Backward compatible:** Import/export compatible with PowerShell version JSON format

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **.NET 10** - Latest LTS framework
- **C# 12** - Primary language with nullable reference types
- **Avalonia 11.3** - Cross-platform XAML UI framework (FluentTheme)
