# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Permission Check Service** — new `IPermissionCheckService` / `PermissionCheckService` in Core
  - Acquires the current token via `TokenCredential`, base64url-decodes the JWT payload, and compares granted permissions against the 14 known-required Graph scopes
  - Supports both application tokens (`roles` claim) and delegated tokens (`scp` claim)
  - Returns a `PermissionCheckResult` model with `GrantedPermissions`, `MissingPermissions`, `ExtraPermissions`, `AllPermissionsGranted`, and `ClaimSource`
  - Fire-and-forget check fired immediately after successful tenant connection; result logged to Debug Log and stored on `MainWindowViewModel.LastPermissionCheckResult`
  - 15 unit tests covering JWT decoding, classification, interface contract, and edge cases (empty/malformed JWT, no permission claim)
- **Permissions Window** — new non-modal `PermissionsWindow` displaying:
  - Summary pill: green "All 15/15 Granted" or red "N/15 Granted"
  - Token type badge (`roles` = application / `scp` = delegated)
  - Missing permissions section (red ✗, only visible when there are gaps)
  - Granted permissions section (green ✓)
  - Collapsible Extra permissions expander
  - "Not connected" placeholder when no check result is available
  - Accessible via **Help → Permissions...** menu item (disabled when not connected)
- Added `IntuneGraphClientFactory.CreateClientWithCredentialAsync` — returns a `(GraphServiceClient, TokenCredential, string[])` tuple so the credential used for authentication can be reused by `PermissionCheckService` without a second auth round-trip
- Added three AXAML value converters in `Converters/PermissionConverters.cs`:
  - `PermissionSummaryBrushConverter` — `bool → SolidColorBrush` (green / red)
  - `PermissionSummaryTextConverter` — `PermissionCheckResult → "All N/N Granted"` summary string
  - `CountGreaterThanZeroConverter` — `int → bool` for conditional visibility bindings

### Changed

- Moved **Permissions** toolbar button into the **Help** menu as "🔑 Permissions..." to reduce toolbar clutter; item is disabled when not connected

### Fixed

- **Settings Catalog HTTP 500** — Cosmos DB skip-token cursor failures caused by over-large page requests
  - Reduced `$top` from 999 → 100 (more stable for Cosmos-backed stores)
  - Added retry loop with exponential backoff (2 s / 4 s) for transient 500 errors
  - Returns partial results instead of throwing on retry exhaustion
- **Quality Update Profiles HTTP 400** — `$top=999` exceeded the endpoint's hard cap of 200; reduced to `$top=200`
- **Driver Update Profiles HTTP 400** — same fix as Quality Update Profiles

### Documentation

- Updated `docs/GRAPH-PERMISSIONS.md`:
  - Added "Windows 365 — Cloud PC" section (`CloudPC.ReadWrite.All` permission + notes on Windows 365 licence requirement)
  - Added 9 previously missing service rows to the endpoint permission table (QualityUpdate, DriverUpdate, DeviceShellScript, ComplianceScript, AdmxFile, AppleDep, DeviceCategory, CloudPcProvisioning, CloudPcUserSettings)
  - Expanded existing permission rows to document all services that rely on each scope
- Updated `scripts/Setup-IntegrationTestApp.ps1`: added `CloudPC.ReadWrite.All` to `$requiredPermissions`

### Added

- **Conditional Access PowerPoint Export** (Phase 1-5 complete)
  - New service: `IConditionalAccessPptExportService` / `ConditionalAccessPptExportService`
  - Generates comprehensive PowerPoint presentations with:
    - Cover slide with tenant name and timestamp
    - Tenant summary with policy counts
    - Policy inventory table (all policies)
    - Per-policy detail slides (conditions, grant controls, assignments)
  - UI integration: Export button visible in Conditional Access category
  - File save dialog with timestamped default filename
  - Async export with cancellation support and progress feedback
  - 11 comprehensive unit tests (parameter validation, file creation, PPTX structure)
  - Commercial cloud support (v1); GCC/GCC-High/DoD deferred to future release
- Added Syncfusion.Presentation.Net.Core v28.1.33 dependency for PowerPoint generation
- Added Syncfusion license initialization via `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable
- Updated SERVICE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md with Wave 6 (CA PowerPoint Export Integration)
- Documented Syncfusion licensing requirements in README.md

### Documentation

- Added `PR_STATUS.md` - comprehensive pull request organization and status tracking document
  - Categorizes all 9 open PRs by priority (P1/P2/P3) and type
  - Documents PR dependencies and recommended merge order
  - Provides detailed analysis of each PR's purpose and risks
  - Includes action items and decision points for repository owner

## [2026-02-18 Release]

### Added

- Added new Graph-backed services and interfaces for:
  - Conditional Access Policies (`IConditionalAccessPolicyService`, `ConditionalAccessPolicyService`)
  - Assignment Filters (`IAssignmentFilterService`, `AssignmentFilterService`)
  - Policy Sets (`IPolicySetService`, `PolicySetService`)
- Added manual `@odata.nextLink` pagination patterns to newly introduced list operations.
- Added new navigation categories and table wiring for:
  - Conditional Access
  - Assignment Filters
  - Policy Sets
- Added dedicated detail-pane sections for the new categories in the desktop UI.
- Added cache-first support for the new categories, including:
  - cache keys
  - lazy load flags
  - cache restore on connect
  - cache persistence on successful loads
- Added asynchronous lazy loading for the new categories when navigating to their tabs.
- Added `HumanDateTimeConverter` and applied it to detail-pane timestamp displays.
- Added Wave 4–5 Graph-backed services and interfaces for:
  - Windows Autopilot deployment profiles
  - Device Health Scripts
  - macOS Custom Attributes
  - Feature Update Profiles
  - Named Locations
  - Authentication Strength policies
  - Authentication Context references
  - Terms of Use agreements
- Added Wave 4–5 export/import parity coverage in core tests, including new service contract tests.
- Added Graph endpoint audit artifacts:
  - `docs/graph-uri-inventory.csv`
  - `docs/GRAPH_URI_AUDIT.md`
- Added `Micke-K/IntuneManagement` as a Git submodule for endpoint parity and reference.

### Changed

- Rebranded product/user-facing naming to **Intune Commander** across app surfaces and documentation.
- Updated assembly metadata (`AssemblyTitle`, `Product`) to Intune Commander.
- Updated repository URL references to the renamed remote.
- Improved dark/light theme behavior by moving hardcoded UI text/error colors to dynamic theme brushes.
- Tuned left navigation text color for dark mode readability with a dedicated nav text brush.
- Expanded `MainWindowViewModel` category refresh/filter/selection flows to include new service categories.
- Extended `IExportService` / `ExportService` and `IImportService` / `ImportService` with Wave 4–5 object types and migration-map support.
- Updated connection flow to use cache-first behavior for expanded cached dataset coverage.
- Updated refresh behavior to keep new categories lazy (load on selected tab) instead of always eagerly fetching.

### Fixed

- Fixed right-pane “no selection” placeholder logic to account for newly added selection types.
- Fixed XAML issues introduced during detail card expansion:
  - invalid `WrapPanel` size setting (`ItemWidth="Auto"`)
  - invalid `PolicySet` property binding
- Resolved startup/runtime XAML load instability by correcting compile-time XAML errors and validating clean rebuilds.
- Fixed build regressions caused by temporary method-placement/bracing conflicts in `MainWindowViewModel`.
- Fixed remaining Avalonia compiled binding errors in detail panes by replacing invalid `Description` bindings for `NamedLocation` and `Agreement` with valid model properties.

### UX Improvements

- Improved readability of secondary text and error text in dark theme.
- Enhanced new detail cards with richer metadata:
  - Conditional Access: state, timestamps, control indicators
  - Policy Sets: item count, timestamps
- Standardized detail-pane timestamp formatting to human-readable local time.

### Documentation

- Updated branding and links in key project docs (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, planning docs, and Copilot instructions).
- Documented Graph URI inventory and service expansion mapping.

### Build & Validation

- Verified successful desktop project builds after each major implementation wave.
- Validated no remaining compile diagnostics for impacted files at release cut.
- Confirmed full core test pass (`175` passed) via `dotnet test` after Wave 4–5 integration.
